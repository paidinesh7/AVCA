# DATA PRIVACY — This .gitignore protects company data
# =============================================================
# This repo is a PUBLIC template. The .gitignore is configured
# to prevent company financials, investor updates, and generated
# analysis from being accidentally committed and pushed.
#
# DO NOT weaken these rules. If you need to share outputs,
# export them manually — never commit them to git.
# =============================================================

# Company update files (raw investor data — never commit)

# Generated outputs containing company data
# (Templates are tracked separately — these catch populated/dated files)

# block *.pdf etc., but explicit rules make intent clear)

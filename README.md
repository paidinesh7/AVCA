# AVCA

An AI-powered investment management tool for venture teams. It does two things:

1. **Portfolio Tracking** — Drop quarterly updates (PDFs, Excel, PPTs) into company folders. Claude extracts financials, flags risks, tracks promises, and produces structured dashboards your team can act on.

2. **Deal Flow Management** — Drop pitch decks into the Deal Flow folder. Claude scores each pitch on a 100-point rubric, ranks them by priority, and produces a single evaluation dashboard. When you invest, the company graduates to your portfolio.

All generated outputs stay on your machine. File contents are sent to Anthropic's API for analysis (that's how Claude works) but are never transmitted anywhere else.

## Quick Start

### Portfolio Tracking

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd AVCA
   ```

2. **Create a folder for each portfolio company**
   ```
   mkdir "Fintech - Acme Payments"
   mkdir "Climate - GreenCo"
   ```
   Folder format: `{Sector} - {Company Name}/`

3. **Drop update files into the company folder**
   - PDFs (investor updates, board decks)
   - Excel files (MIS, P&L, KPIs)
   - PowerPoint files (quarterly presentations)

4. **Run Claude Code in this directory**
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
   Then say: *"Process the new updates"*

5. **Open the HTML outputs in your browser**
   - `Claude Summary/Portfolio Dashboard.html` — one-page portfolio view
   - `Claude Summary/Red Flags & Follow-ups.html` — action items and warnings
   - `Claude Summary/Promise Tracker.html` — company accountability dashboard
   - `Claude Summary/Collaboration Opportunities.html` — cross-portfolio synergies
   - `Claude Summary/Team Update - {Month} {Year}.html` — shareable team summary

### Deal Flow Management

1. **Create a folder for the pitch inside `Deal Flow/`**
   ```
   mkdir -p "Deal Flow/Fintech - NovaPay"
   mkdir -p "Deal Flow/Climate - GreenGrid"
   ```

2. **Drop pitch documents into the folder** — decks, one-pagers, financial models

3. **Run Claude Code** and say: *"Evaluate the new pitches"*

4. **Open the output:** `Claude Summary/Deal Flow.html` — ranked prioritization dashboard

## How It Works

Claude reads the `CLAUDE.md` file in this repo for all its instructions. When you start a Claude Code session in this directory, it knows how to handle both workflows.

### Portfolio Processing Flow

```
Drop files into company folder
        ↓
Run Claude → detects new files
        ↓
Processes ONE company at a time
        ↓
Updates 5 files: Running Summary + Dashboard + Red Flags + Promise Tracker + Collaboration Opportunities
        ↓
Asks which company to process next
        ↓
After all companies → generates Team Update
```

### Pitch Evaluation Flow

```
Drop pitch docs into Deal Flow/{Sector} - {Company}/
        ↓
Run Claude → detects new pitches
        ↓
Evaluates ONE pitch at a time (100-point rubric: Team, Market, Traction, Product, Business Model, Deal Terms)
        ↓
Updates Deal Flow.html (pitch card + comparison table + sector distribution)
        ↓
Asks which pitch to evaluate next
        ↓
If invested → company graduates to portfolio tracking
```

### Detecting New Files

Run the detection script to see what hasn't been processed yet. It scans both portfolio folders and Deal Flow in separate passes:

```bash
bash detect_new_files.sh
```

## Data Privacy

This repo is designed to be **public** — it's a template others can clone and use. The protections are built in at multiple layers to prevent company data from leaking beyond what's necessary.

### How data flows

**When Claude Code reads your files, the content is sent to Anthropic's API for analysis.** This is inherent to how Claude Code works — it cannot process files locally. Anthropic's data handling is governed by their [usage policy](https://www.anthropic.com/policies). Review it and make sure it meets your organization's requirements before processing sensitive financial data.

The protections below prevent company data from leaking **beyond Anthropic** — to git, to third-party services, or to the public internet.

### How your data is protected

**Layer 1 — `.gitignore` (automatic):**
- All raw company files are blocked: PDFs, Excel (.xlsx/.xls), PowerPoint (.pptx/.ppt), CSV, Word docs
- Generated analysis files are blocked: `Running Summary.md`, `Monthly Report*`, `Team Update*`
- Deal Flow pitch files are explicitly blocked with additional patterns
- These files **cannot** be committed even if you run `git add .`

**Layer 2 — Claude's instructions (`CLAUDE.md`):**
- Claude is instructed to write all analysis **only** to local files in `Claude Summary/`
- Claude will **never** run commands that send data to third-party services (no `curl`, `wget`, webhooks, etc.)
- Claude will **never** suggest uploading, emailing, or posting company data to any external service
- Claude will **never** include company financials in commit messages or git logs
- File processing uses local tools where possible (Python/openpyxl for Excel, shell utilities)

**Layer 3 — Offline HTML outputs:**
- All HTML dashboards use **inline CSS only** — no external stylesheets, fonts, CDN links, analytics, or tracking
- Opening them in your browser makes **zero network requests** — fully offline
- You can verify this yourself: open any HTML file and check the browser's Network tab

### What requires your attention

- The HTML dashboards ship as **empty templates** in this repo. Once you process companies or pitches, they contain real data. **Do not commit the populated versions.** If `git status` shows them as modified, that's your company data — don't stage or push it.
- **Commit messages and PR descriptions** are public. Never reference specific company financials in them.

**Before pushing any changes:**
```bash
git diff --name-only    # Review what files changed
git diff                # Review the actual content — make sure no company data is included
```

**If you accidentally committed company data:**
```bash
git reset HEAD~1        # Undo the last commit (keeps your files intact)
```

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (Anthropic's CLI tool)
- Python 3 with `openpyxl` (for Excel files): `pip install openpyxl`

## Tips

- **Folder naming matters.** Always use `{Sector} - {Company Name}/`. No dates in folder names.
- **One at a time.** Claude processes companies and pitches sequentially to keep context clean.
- **Incremental updates.** When new files arrive for a company already processed, Claude adds a dated update section — it doesn't rewrite the whole summary.
- **Edit CLAUDE.md** to add your company details to the Portfolio Companies table. This helps Claude track what's in the portfolio.
- **Check the tracker.** The "Key Files Processed" and "Pitches Evaluated" sections in CLAUDE.md track what's been read.
- **Graduation.** When you invest in a pitch, move its folder from `Deal Flow/` to the repo root and process it as a portfolio company.

## Customization

The system is designed to be customizable:

- **Sectors:** Use whatever sector labels fit your portfolio (SaaS, Climate, Fintech, Health, etc.)
- **Template:** Edit the Standard Summary Template in CLAUDE.md to match what your team cares about
- **Scoring rubric:** Edit the Scoring Framework in CLAUDE.md to adjust dimension weights for deal flow
- **HTML styling:** The HTML templates use embedded CSS — modify the styles to match your brand
- **Extraction focus:** Edit "What to Extract" in CLAUDE.md to prioritize different metrics
